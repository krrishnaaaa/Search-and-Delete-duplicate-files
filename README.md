Search-and-Delete-duplicate-files
=================================

Java source code to search a directory, recursively, for duplicate files. Well, this code is not commented, but feel free to query.

Feel free to reorganize code, and distribute your own version. I would be happy if you could state your name and application, in which this code is used.
